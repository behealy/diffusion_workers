      IMPORTANT: DO NOT CALL ANY OTHER COMMANDS OTHER THAN THOSE THAT ARE SPECIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS:
      1. Create a new git branch called add_docs/hf_diffusers.
      2. Then run git clone git@github.com:huggingface/diffusers.git here, and once that is downloaded, copy the contents of the docs/source/en folder into a new folder called docs/hf_diffusers in this workspace, then delete the diffusers folder that was just downloaded by git.
      3. Then find _toctree.yml in the docs/hf_diffusers folder and write a reference to it under the # Documentation section in .continue/rules/CONTINUE.md. If .continue/rules/CONTINUE.md does not exist, create it.
      4. Then add and commit the changes to the new branch with a commit message.
